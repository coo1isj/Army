You are alone and have the hard task of infiltrating a small camp occupied by known enemies. No allies are available on hand, just your sergeant(Case)
on your radio. Your task, target the leader and eliminate him and make it out alive, or eliminate all threats.

1.
Your eyes slowly open and you wonder where you are for a slight moment until you remember that you're in a little clabin oustide a enemy camp in south argentina. One of their military lieutenants has been causing trouble to the US for long enough, that is why you remember your task, eliminate him and make it out alive. You've been silently waiting for your sergeant to contact you on your radio before engaging the enemy that is located about 1km west.

c) open the door and take a quick glance outside
d) decide it has been long enough and use the radio to contact your sergeant

2. (from 1a)
You sit down and place your back on the wall, you wait for your vision to adjust to the darkness. You start to make up some shapes around the cabin like the desk that is directly in front of you and the shelf to your left next to the small door leading to the outside. You wait for what seems like an eternity until finally your radio starts beeping. You pick up and your sergeant tells you "Start heading to the outskirts of the village at 0300 and when you're there contact me for your next order" and then the radio closes.

a) get up, open the lights and start getting your gear ready
